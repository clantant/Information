\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{The Person}
Many people have told me that they could never work with computers and code. Some say it's too hard and others say it's too complicated. They are both right, it is complicated and hard to program and design software. I enjoy the challenge and discovery that is required to understand different software systems. I've learned a lot from both my professional and academic experience.

\lettersection{The Journey}
When I started college I was an electrical and computer engineering major because I was interested in systems and the combination of software and hardware. After being fascinated by the way code is written and read I made the switch to computer science. I've learned from creating a database and website using php and mysql to writing assembler for an embedded platform.
The knowledge of systems set the groundwork for my internship wherein I focused on building, packaging, and releasing software. My primary goal was to make it easier and less involved to update open-source packages as part of a distributed build framework. Primarily I worked with Ruby and received Puppet fundamentals training as part of my tenure. Finally, my most recent work I have been focusing on a custom Linux distribution including building and packaging. Most of my experience was in debugging large complicated software stacks using tools like strace and wireshark.

\lettersection{The Destination}
I am interested in this position because I think it fits with my skillset and I can excel at the problems I would expect to encounter. I strive to come up to speed quickly and enjoy learning new languages, tools, and implementations. I appreciate your time and hope to hear from you soon.
