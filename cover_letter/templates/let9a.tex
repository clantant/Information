Dear Seeq Hiring Staff:
 
\noindent I am applying for a developer, backend, position with Seeq. I am interested in the position because of the new technology and use of open source technologies. I also am interested in being able to work from home.
 
\noindent I have come to the understanding over college that I can code well and so development is in line with what I would excel at. My educational and professional experiences have been mainly through college classes. I have gone through a class on UNIX/POSIX compliant system calls and Linux based software, such as implementing the ar command. I have had algorithms, data structures, and MySQL classes and covered a lot of the theory and some practice. I have really enjoyed coding in python and C especially when I am given a challenge and just told to solve it.

\noindent I have worked for Puppet Labs previously as a release engineering intern. I learned a lot from that experience, good coding habits, linux development, and how to work effectively in a team in industry.

\noindent I am looking to start working after I finish spring term. The final day is Friday, June 12th, and I can begin work Monday, June 15th at the earliest. My availability is all hours of the week.

\noindent Thank you for considering my resume and cover letter. I hope that I could be a good fit for Seeq and I think I could help with new ideas and my passion for good code.
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
