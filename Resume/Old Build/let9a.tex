\opening{Dear Puppet Hiring Staff:} 
 
\noindent I am applying for an internship with Puppet Labs. I am interested in the position because of the culture of Puppet Labs, with open source everyone collaborates more and you can challenge yourself with whichever aspect of the project you like.
 
\noindent The areas that I am interested in are development, QA, release/packaging, or tech operations. I have come to the understanding over college that I can code well and so development might be more in line with what I would excel at. My educational and professional experiences have been mainly through college classes. I have gone through a class on UNIX/POSIX compliant system calls and Linux based software, such as implementing the ar command. I have had algorithms, data structures, and MySQL classes and covered a lot of the theory and some practice. I have really enjoyed coding in python and C especially when I am given a challenge and just told to solve it.

\noindent I am looking to start interning after I finish spring term. The final day is Friday, June 13th, and I can begin work Monday, June 16th at the earliest. I can then continue work until the end of September when classes start up again. Since I will be out of school I will be able to work any time of the day and any day of the week. 

\noindent Thank you for considering my resume and cover letter. I hope that I could be a good fit for Puppet Labs and I think I could learn a lot and help with any aspect that I am assigned to.
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
